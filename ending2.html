<h2>
  THE END
</h2>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The entrance from the board opens into a cold, metal covered room. It feels like ice, and out of the whole house, is the only room that is not run down. Each teen steps in, examining the cold, fog filled room. Their teeth chatter together, they cross their arms and look around. How can this room be so cold when no one is here?
</p>
<p>
  The wall slams shut, and at the sounds of the teens' screams, a low, deep laugh echos throughout the house.
