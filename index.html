        THE STORY BEGINS....
    </h2>
    </p>
  <p>
      One foggy night, at 18 Maplewood Lane, a group of teens found the remains of an abandoned house. It used to belong to the Creep Family, a strange and peculiar bunch who were kept to themselves. No one knew much about them, other than the fact that their daughter was in and out of rehab and the son had a tendency to play with fire.

    These four teens, Gabby, Olivia, Nick, and Ethan, who wandered into the Creep family home were far too curious for the people of their small town. When things happen, no one seems to care. But this group of kids did, and they wanted to know what truly happened the night of the Creep family's disappearance.

    Upon entering the house, the small group of four took in the vast foyer. Vines and moss covered the walls and floor. Creaking, cracked floor boards were spread throughout the house, and the wallpaper was peeling away from the walls.

    The teens discuss where to explore next, and must choose between Gabby's idea of looking in the living room, where the family spent their time together, or Ethan's suggestion of going upstairs to find out the secrets hidden in the Creep family's bedrooms...
