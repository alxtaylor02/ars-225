<h2>
  THE LIVING ROOM...

  The living room was barren of life. The fireplace stood in the center of the
  room, covered in cobwebs and dust. Olivia ran her finger across the surface,
  moving the dust and grime between her thumb and forefinger.

  The teens wandered the room, exploring the empty house. There was a plastic
  covered couch, with a huge brown stain across the arm rest. Other than that,
  it looked untouched, almost idyllic. Nick passed his hand across the wood
  panelled walls, feeling the dips and curves and knots in the wood. He found a
  loose board slip past his fingers, and put his hand back on the spot.
